            <p class="light">
              A derivative of "Kanban", a task tracking and management system. Expanded on the idea of rule based states and user roles.
              Was built during a hackathon with a team of four using the MEAN Stack. 
              Idea came from the need for small teams to be able to effeciently track and verify progress on projects.

            <p class="light">
              A clone of "Flikr" that allows for users to upload images and sort though the images based on the faces in the image.
              To accomplish this I came up with a versitile microservice architecture that separated image uploading from the "face-finder"
              The whole app was orchistrated using docker and was written in TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python; 
              using Amazon S3, RabbitMQ, Redis, and MongoDB. For "face-finder" we used OpenCV.

            <h5 class="center">Radius Chat</h5>

            <p class="light">
              Named for the fact that it is a radius based group chat app. The idea is that a user can set the radius in meters from how far they want to recieve messages from.
              Each message has a location that is associated with it for the server to dicern which users to send that message to.
              This app was written using the MEAN stack, using Ionic 1.0 instead of Angular.

              Much of my developer expirence has been working on cloud based systems. My first internship at Interactive Intelligence was working on an automated QA team for an AWS based architecture.
              After that many of the projects that I have worked on have all ran on virtual machines in the cloud. My expirience at Amazon has also helped me learn more techniques for working on Cloud Based Microservices Archetectures.

                I have always had an appetite for leadership. From being the team captain in Highschool for the Fine Arts Academic team, to being the president of Computer Science Club for the last 3 years.
                I am comfortable leading small groups of developers to finish a project at a hackathon or leading a team of peers in class projects.

          <h4>About Me</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">
            I was born and raised in Columbus, Indiana which is a small diverse midwestern town, that has been described as the "Athens of the Prairie."
            I have always had an interest in computers, but it was not until taking more indepth classes in High School that I knew it was my passion.
            From there I went to Purdue School of Science at Indianapolis for Computer Science. Here I found a great community that helped me grow my skills as a freshman.
            I got involved with Computer Science Club and as a freshman was the Senator for CS Club. I also networked with other members and got an internship with Interactive Intelligence that summer.
            Since sophomore year I have been the President of Computer Science Club, we I have grown membership from 70 to over 200 members.
            I have also gotten the club more involved with the local Software Engineering community, by inviting companies out to give talks to the club.
            This last summer I had the oppurtunity to intern with Amazon as a Software Development Engineer Intern. This was a great expirence and greatly improved my skills as an engineer.
            I graduate in May 2018 and look forward to new horizons in the future.
